  - Rain reduces traffic volume by approximately 15-20%
  - Snow causes more severe reductions (30-40% in heavy conditions)
- Temperature extremes correlate with lower traffic volumes
- Clear weather correlates with higher traffic volumes than adverse conditions
- Gradual weather changes have less impact than sudden weather events

### 8.1 Model Selection Rationale

The selection of Random Forest as the production model was based on:

1. **Superior Performance Metrics**: Highest RÂ² score (0.84) and lowest error metrics (MAE: 499.59, RMSE: 789.71)
2. **Ensemble Advantages**: As an ensemble method, Random Forest mitigates overfitting issues common in individual decision trees
3. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Provides valuable insights into which factors most significantly influence traffic patterns
4. **Robustness**: Shows consistent performance across various input conditions and is less susceptible to outliers
5. **Interpretability**: Maintains a reasonable level of interpretability compared to black-box models

XGBoost showed comparable performance (RÂ² score of 0.83) and remains a viable alternative model that could potentially outperform Random Forest with additional tuning.
